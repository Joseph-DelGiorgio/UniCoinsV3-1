UNCollaboration Smart Contract
The UNCollaboration smart contract is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to facilitate collaboration between volunteers, project managers, and donors. The contract allows volunteers to complete tasks and earn UNCollaboration coins (UNC), which they can use to propose and fund new projects. Project managers can validate and manage proposed projects, and donors can donate UNC to support new projects.

Features
The UNCollaboration smart contract includes the following features:

Task management: Project managers can add new tasks to the contract, and volunteers can complete tasks and earn UNC as a reward.
Volunteer management: Project managers can add new volunteers to the contract.
Project manager management: Existing project managers can add new project managers to the contract.
Token minting: Project managers can mint new UNC tokens and allocate them to specific addresses.
Staking: Volunteers can stake UNC tokens to propose new projects, and project managers can validate and manage proposed projects.
Donations: Donors can donate UNC to support new projects.
Time stable coin: The contract includes a data strategy to optimize UNC circulation and ensure the time value of UNC is maintained, making it similar to a time-stable coin.
Requirements
The following tools and libraries are required to use the UNCollaboration smart contract:

Solidity compiler version 0.8.0
OpenZeppelin library version 4.4.0
Deployment
To deploy the UNCollaboration smart contract, follow these steps:

Install Solidity and OpenZeppelin on your local machine.
Copy the contents of the UNCollaboration.sol file into a new Solidity file.
Compile the Solidity file using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the compiled smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
Usage
Once the smart contract is deployed, the following functions can be called to interact with the contract:

addTask: Add a new task to the contract.
completeTask: Mark a task as completed and reward the volunteer who completed it with UNC.
addVolunteer: Add a new volunteer to the contract.
addProjectManager: Add a new project manager to the contract.
mintTokens: Mint new UNC tokens and allocate them to specific addresses.
proposeProject: Propose a new project by staking UNC tokens.
validateProposal: Validate or reject a proposed project.
updateProjectDeliverables: Update the deliverables of a proposed project.
setOrganizationAccount: Set the address of the organization account.
donate: Donate UNC to support new projects.
mintForProject: Mint UNC tokens to fund a proposed project.
